    tag: "r_d_tax_reliefs"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "Support companies in investing in innovative projects across science and technology sectors. By reducing the effective cost of R&D through tax relief, the policy seeks to unlock additional private sector investment and drive economic growth, particularly encouraging businesses that might otherwise underinvest in research and development."
      optimal_conditions: "Works best in environments with an established business base, mature tax infrastructure, and stable fiscal outlook. Particularly effective when broad-based R&D stimulus is needed rather than targeted support."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "Companies submit documentation detailing their qualifying R&D expenditure and can claim a taxable credit at 20% under the Research and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) scheme. Loss-making R&D-intensive SMEs can access Enhanced R&D Intensive Support (ERIS) with an enhanced deduction of 86% and payable tax credit up to 14.5%. The system operates through existing tax infrastructure, with companies claiming relief through their regular tax returns."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**Low** – broad eligibility across all sectors"
      technological: "**Low** – cannot target specific technologies or innovation priorities"
      regional: "**Low** – no geographic differentiation in rates or eligibility"
      by_firm_type: "**Moderate** – separate schemes for SMEs vs larger companies (ERIS vs RDEC)"
      overall_assessment: "**Broad-brush tool** – excellent for general R&D stimulus, poor for strategic targeting."

    # EFFECTIVENESS
    effectiveness:
      what_works: "Delivers impressive leverage with £7.5B in relief generating £46.7B in R&D spending. Low administrative complexity since it operates through existing tax infrastructure, provides fast cash delivery within months. Evidence shows additionality: RDEC demonstrates £2.40-£2.70 of additional R&D per £1 of public money, while the SME scheme shows £0.60-£1.28 per £1. Currently heavily utilised with 65,690 claims in 2022-23, showing strong business uptake."
      what_doesnt: "Limited strategic targeting capability - unsuitable when specific technologies or sectors need priority support. Moderate fraud risk (£1B lost in 2020-21). Fast cash delivery but slow economic impact - broader benefits like productivity gains emerge over years."
      additionality: "**Medium-High evidence** - Multiple studies show genuine additionality, though exact amounts are contested due to methodological debates."
      timeline: "Immediate cash flow benefits, long-term economic impact over 3-5 years."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Use as part of a broad-based innovation strategy, particularly in service-driven economies like the UK."
      - "Not suitable when strategic targeting of specific technologies, sectors, or regions is the priority."
      - "Consider combining with direct grants to address strategic priorities that tax credits cannot target."
      - "Build robust anti-fraud measures from the outset - this is critical for long-term success."
      - "The UK's heavy reliance on tax credits versus direct measures may not adequately address manufacturing competitiveness or strategic technology priorities like AI or clean energy."

    # IMPLEMENTATION
    implementation:
      lead_body: "HMRC"
      ease: "**Low complexity** – operates through existing tax infrastructure, with administrative costs pushed to beneficiaries"
      flexibility: "**Medium** – tax changes can be introduced at fiscal events, but major changes can prove controversial without adequate consultation"

  - name: "Innovation inducement prizes"
    tag: "innovation_inducement_prizes"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "Unlock breakthrough solutions in situations where the desired end product is clear but the development path is uncertain. Aims to draw in non-traditional solvers who might not typically engage with government R&D programs and raise the salience of important problems that need innovative solutions."
      optimal_conditions: "Most effective at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) around 3, where technical risk is high and the ideal innovator is unknown. Works particularly well when publicity value is important for highlighting a problem or building a community around a challenge."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "The government offers a monetary prize against clearly defined success criteria, with entrants funding their own R&D efforts and claiming the prize only if they meet the specified goal. This approach shifts risk to participants while providing strong incentives for breakthrough solutions. Prizes can be structured with multiple stages or milestone payments to maintain momentum throughout development."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**Variable** – can target any sector by choice of prize theme"
      technological: "**High** – success criteria can pinpoint a single specific technical goal"
      regional: "**Low** – the geographic location of winners is difficult to steer or predict"
      by_firm_type: "**Moderate** – typical beneficiaries tend to be start-ups and SMEs with lower overhead costs"
      overall_assessment: "**Precise but narrow** – best suited for focused technical challenges with clear success metrics."

    # EFFECTIVENESS
    effectiveness:
      what_works: "Government only pays for successful outcomes, eliminating the risk of funding failed projects. Leverage can reach 10:1 in large prizes as participants invest their own resources. Can attract unconventional innovators and generate significant publicity for important challenges. UK examples include the Manchester Prize (£1 million for AI applications in clean energy) and Longitude Prizes - these represent modest experiments with particular promise for spotlighting early-stage challenges in net zero transition or national security areas."
      what_doesnt: "Prize design and evaluation processes are complex and resource-intensive. Risk of duplication as multiple teams work on similar approaches without coordination. Evidence base for effectiveness remains thin, making it difficult to predict outcomes or optimise design."
      additionality: "**Low-Medium evidence** - Additionality likely to be high when a precise target product profile is established, but approach remains untested when rewards simply go to 'best in class' without clear performance thresholds."
      timeline: "Dependent on prize duration and complexity, typically requires years for meaningful technical breakthroughs. Impact may be accelerated if prizes successfully catalyse broader investment or research interest."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Reserve innovation prizes for problems at TRL approximately 3 where the pool of potential innovators is unknown or needs to be expanded beyond traditional players."
      - "Keep R&D costs relatively low for entrants to maximize participation, and guard against overly generic criteria that fail to drive specific innovation."
      - "Consider prizes as part of broader innovation ecosystems rather than standalone interventions."

    # IMPLEMENTATION
    implementation:
      lead_body: "DSIT, Innovate UK, Nesta"
      ease: "**High complexity** – requires specialist technical assessors, extensive outreach and communications, often staged payment systems"
      flexibility: "**Variable** – once launched, prize terms are difficult to alter without undermining credibility, but new prizes can be designed to respond to emerging challenges"

  - name: "Advance market commitments"
    tag: "advance_market_commitments"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "Create a guaranteed market that spurs both invention and production scaling in areas where demand uncertainty is a major barrier to private investment. Particularly valuable for creating entirely new markets or accelerating the development of products with high social value but uncertain commercial demand."
      optimal_conditions: "Most effective at TRL 3-5 where technical feasibility is emerging but market demand is highly uncertain. Works best when fixed production costs are high, few alternative buyers exist, and the social value of the innovation significantly exceeds likely private returns."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "Government makes an upfront commitment to purchase or subsidize a future product that meets a specified target profile, thereby reducing demand uncertainty and encouraging private investment in R&D and scale-up. The commitment provides a guaranteed market for innovations that meet predetermined criteria, with payment typically contingent on delivery of products meeting agreed specifications."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**Moderate** – frequently used in life sciences, net zero technologies, and defense applications"
      technological: "**High** – target product profiles can provide precise technical specifications and performance requirements"
      regional: "**Low** – difficult to control where production and innovation activities locate"
      by_firm_type: "**Low** – larger firms are typically better positioned to deliver at the scale required by government commitments"
      overall_assessment: "**Market-making tool** – powerful for creating new markets but capital-intensive and requires long-term commitment."

    # EFFECTIVENESS
    effectiveness:
      what_works: "Can crowd in major private R&D investment by providing demand certainty that unlocks private capital. Government only pays upon successful delivery of specified products, minimizing risk of funding failure. Fraud risk is typically low due to clear delivery requirements and product verification processes. UK has participated in international pneumococcal and COVAX vaccine commitments, with a pilot program for low-carbon concrete underway."
      what_doesnt: "Potentially very expensive if successful, requiring substantial long-term budget commitments. Design complexity is high, requiring detailed technical specifications and market analysis. Vulnerable to industry capture if incumbent players unduly influence specification setting."
      additionality: "**Low-Medium evidence** - Additionality effects remain unclear from existing studies. Economic theory suggests high additionality where products are distant from current market viability, but empirical evidence is limited."
      timeline: "Typically extends beyond a single parliamentary term, depending on starting TRL and required scale-up. Long-term nature creates challenges for political sustainability."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Deploy advance market commitments specifically when demand risk is the primary constraint on private investment, rather than technical or regulatory barriers."
      - "Avoid using this tool for products that are already near-market viability, as this risks displacing rather than additional private investment."
      - "Maintain credible long-term funding commitments even across changes of government, as credibility is essential for effectiveness."
      - "Shows particular promise for pandemic preparedness and hard-to-abate net zero technologies where uncertain future carbon pricing creates investment barriers."

    # IMPLEMENTATION
    implementation:
      lead_body: "HM Treasury, BEIS or successor, Innovate UK"
      ease: "**High complexity** – requires detailed technical specification development, ongoing monitoring, often complex international coordination"
      flexibility: "**Low** – commitments must remain credible and stable over many years to provide effective investment signals"

    tag: "innovation_grants_for_business"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "Help companies grow by developing and commercialising new products, processes, and services within a strong innovation ecosystem. Addresses market failures where private investment in innovation is insufficient due to spillover effects, high risk, or financing constraints, particularly for SMEs and collaborative projects."
      optimal_conditions: "Most effective when firms face financing gaps or spillover risks at TRL 3-7, and where collaboration between organizations can enhance innovation outcomes. Works particularly well for projects that are too risky for private finance but have clear commercial potential."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "Businesses apply to competitive Innovate UK funding calls, with grants typically covering 50% of eligible costs for large firms and up to 67% for SMEs. Support is delivered through various mechanisms including collaborative R&D projects involving multiple organizations, Smart grants for individual company innovation projects, and feasibility studies for early-stage concepts. The competitive process involves expert assessment of both technical merit and commercial potential."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**High** – competitions can be designed as thematic calls focusing on specific sectors or as open calls across all areas"
      technological: "**High** – funding calls can define specific focus areas and emerging technology priorities"
      regional: "**Moderate** – Launchpads and Innovation Accelerators provide mechanisms for place-based targeting"
      by_firm_type: "**High** – SME support rates are higher than for large companies, and collaboration rules can steer consortium formation"
      overall_assessment: "**Versatile grant platform** with strong targeting options across multiple dimensions."

    # EFFECTIVENESS
    effectiveness:
      what_works: "Evidence shows high additionality and significant GVA impact, with support backed by three rigorous counterfactual studies. Achieves leverage of approximately 0.67:1, meaning every pound of public funding generates additional private investment. Competitive process helps identify the most promising projects and encourages high standards. Between 2004-2019, supported at least 14,681 businesses with over £2.5 billion in grants, serving as a central pillar of UK innovation policy with strong adaptability to changing priorities including net zero transition and regional growth objectives."
      what_doesnt: "Significant oversubscription creates frustration among applicants and may deter future applications. Success rates vary considerably between competitions, and administrative burden can be substantial for smaller companies despite efforts to streamline processes."
      additionality: "**High evidence** - Rigorous evaluation shows employment increases of 23-27% and turnover growth of 28-14% over six years for supported companies compared to matched control groups."
      timeline: "Turnover and employment effects typically emerge within 1-2 years of grant completion, while productivity improvements generally take 3-5 years to materialise."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Maintain the current mix of thematic and open funding calls to balance strategic priorities with bottom-up innovation."
      - "Scale up Launchpads and regional programs to better address place-based innovation objectives."
      - "Streamline administrative processes for smaller grants while maintaining rigorous assessment for larger awards."
      - "Consider expanding eligibility criteria or funding rates for strategic priority areas."

    # IMPLEMENTATION
    implementation:
      lead_body: "Innovate UK"
      ease: "**Medium complexity** – managed by specialist agency with established processes, but requires significant expert assessment capacity and ongoing project monitoring"
      flexibility: "**High** – new calls can be opened or existing programs paused quickly in response to changing priorities"

  - name: "Contracts for innovation"
    tag: "contracts_for_innovation"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "Help public sector organisations solve challenges by connecting them with innovative businesses to develop cutting-edge and cost-effective solutions. Addresses situations where the market is unlikely to provide solutions independently, particularly for government-specific needs and public sector challenges."
      optimal_conditions: "Most effective at TRL 3-9 where technical solutions are feasible but market incentives are insufficient. Works particularly well when government can act as lead customer and where clear problem statements can be defined with measurable success criteria."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "Public sector organisations run Contracts for Innovation competitions by posing specific problem statements, with companies competing for contracts to develop R&D solutions. The government acts as lead customer, with contracts typically structured in phases: feasibility studies, prototype/product development, and operational testing with public procurement of innovative solutions. This approach shifts from specifying solutions to defining problems that need solving."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**High** – competitions can target specific government department needs or cross-cutting public sector challenges"
      technological: "**High** – problem statements can define precise technical requirements and performance specifications"
      regional: "**Low** – whilst devolved nations make use of the programme, recipients are not regionally targeted"
      by_firm_type: "**Moderate** – accessible to businesses, academic and research organisations, charities and not-for-profits, though businesses constitute the majority of recipients"
      overall_assessment: "**Problem-focused tool** – excellent for addressing specific government challenges but requires active departmental engagement."

    # EFFECTIVENESS
    effectiveness:
      what_works: "Positive impact relatively well evidenced at firm level with high additionality rates. Government only pays for solutions that meet specified criteria, reducing risk of funding failures. Flexible model adaptable to wide range of departments and agencies. Strong leverage demonstrated in healthcare sector with £290m+ private investment from £99m+ public investment. Operating successfully since 2001 with over 100 public sector organisations participating, representing over £1 billion in total spend."
      what_doesnt: "Key challenge is limited traction within many parts of the public sector due to well-recognised structural barriers. Requires extensive departmental administrative resources for success. Public sector benefits remain inadequately evaluated. Significant variation in how different departments interpret and deploy the programme."
      additionality: "**High evidence** - 60% of beneficiaries report projects would not have happened without support, with additional 25% saying projects would have proceeded in reduced form. Gross additional turnover impact of £127k per firm per year."
      timeline: "Several years for full spectrum of outcomes, depending on complexity of challenge and required TRL progression."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Require strategic leadership and funding commitment from the centre to drive more extensive adoption across government departments."
      - "Upgrade monitoring framework and data quality to better demonstrate public sector benefits and optimise programme design."
      - "Maintain flexibility whilst sharing best practice across the programme 'family' to improve consistency and effectiveness."
      - "Invest in raising awareness and building capabilities within procurement, policy, and innovation teams across government."
      - "Make greater use of Phase 3 (operational testing and public procurement) to improve adoption of innovative solutions."

    # IMPLEMENTATION
    implementation:
      lead_body: "Multiple departments and agencies, coordinated guidance available"
      ease: "**High complexity** – requires extensive departmental administrative resource, specialist technical assessment, and ongoing project monitoring"
      flexibility: "**High** – adaptable model that can be tailored to specific departmental needs and challenge areas"

  - name: "Skilled immigration"
    tag: "skilled_immigration"

    # PURPOSE & APPLICATION
    purpose_and_application: 
      why: "Increase the supply of high-skilled talent in the UK to address skills shortages and enhance innovation capacity. Particularly valuable for accessing global talent pools and bringing in individuals with cutting-edge expertise that may be scarce domestically, whilst potentially catalysing additional private R&D investment through entrepreneurship."
      optimal_conditions: "Most effective when skills are genuinely undersupplied domestically and when programmes prioritise merit-based selection over lottery systems. Works particularly well when combined with schemes that promote collaboration between migrants and existing residents."

    # HOW IT WORKS
    how_it_works: "Government enables high-skilled talent to migrate to the UK through targeted visa schemes. Key programmes include the Global Talent Visa (5-year duration for recognised leaders), High Potential Individual Visa (2-3 years for graduates from top universities), and Innovator Founder Visa (3 years for innovative business founders). Applications involve endorsement processes, qualification verification, and various fees including healthcare surcharges."

    # TARGETABILITY
    targetability:
      sectoral: "**Moderate** – Global Talent Visa targets specific sectors including science, medicine, engineering, FinTech, gaming, cybersecurity and AI"
      technological: "**Medium** – cannot precisely control technological focus but existing programmes already target specific high-innovation industries"
      regional: "**Low** – difficult to direct innovation benefits to specific geographic regions"
      by_firm_type: "**High** – benefits universities, large firms, and start-ups, with immigrants more likely to establish new businesses"
      overall_assessment: "**Talent supply tool** – effective for addressing skills gaps but limited geographical targeting capability."

    # EFFECTIVENESS
    effectiveness:
      what_works: "Revenue-generating policy that lacks fiscal costs whilst crowding in extensive private R&D investment. Fast impact timeline with innovation effects visible within one year. Evidence shows 1 percentage point rise in immigrant college graduates increases patents per capita by 6%. Between 2020-2023, granted 12,243 Global Talent visas, 1,342 High Potential Individual visas, and 520 Innovator Founder visas. Evaluation shows 30% of Global Talent visa holders conducting research by mid-2021."
      what_doesnt: "Immigration reform traditionally slow to implement. Mixed evidence on effects on native innovation depending on programme design - lottery-style programmes risk crowding out domestic innovation. Some visa applicants report longer than expected application processing times. High upfront costs may deter applicants compared to competitor nations."
      additionality: "**Mixed evidence** - Points-based systems likely to crowd in innovation, whilst lottery-based systems may crowd out domestic innovation. Effect depends heavily on specific programme design and implementation."
      timeline: "Fast implementation once programmes established - innovation impacts visible within one year of migration."

    # RECOMMENDATIONS
    recommendations:
      - "Prioritise merit-based selection over lottery systems to maximise innovation benefits."
      - "Focus programmes on postgraduate degree holders and undersupplied skills areas."
      - "Include potential start-up founders rather than restricting to job offer holders."
      - "Benchmark visa costs against competitor nations to maintain competitiveness in attracting talent."
      - "Change healthcare surcharge payment schedule to annual rather than upfront to reduce barriers."
      - "Create voluntary opt-in connections between skilled migrants and existing research networks and start-up ecosystems."
      - "Extend High Potential Individual Visa length for degrees in critical demand occupations."

    # IMPLEMENTATION
    implementation:
      lead_body: "Home Office, with endorsing bodies including Royal Society, British Academy, Royal Academy of Engineering, UKRI, Tech Nation"
      ease: "**Low complexity** for adjustments to existing programmes, **High complexity** for creating new programmes"
      flexibility: "**Low** – immigration reform traditionally slow, though programmes could be designed with regular review mechanisms"
